# Python Code Explanation

This Python code collects the user's name and three favorite numbers. It then performs operations on these numbers, classifying them as even or odd, calculating their squares, summing them, and determining if the sum is a prime number.

### Code Breakdown

```python
user_name:str = input('Please Enter Your Name')
```

- This line takes the user's name as an input and stores it in the variable `user_name`. The `str` type hint indicates that this variable is expected to be a string.

```python
favorite_number: list = [int(input(f'Please Enter Favorite Number # {i+1}')) for i in range(3)]
```

- This list comprehension prompts the user to enter three favorite numbers, converting them into integers and storing them in a list named `favorite_number`.

```python
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Let's explore your favorite numbers:")
```

- A friendly greeting to the user, showing their name.

### Identifying Even and Odd Numbers

```python
even: tuple = ()
odd: tuple = ()
for num in favorite_number:
    print(f"Your Favorite Number Is {num}")
```

- Two empty tuples, `even` and `odd`, are created to store even and odd numbers, respectively. The code then iterates over the user's favorite numbers and prints each one.

```python
for num in favorite_number:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even += (num,)
        print(f'The Number {num} Is even')
    else:
        odd += (num,)
        print(f"The Number {num} Is odd")
```

- The code checks whether each number is even or odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the number is divisible by 2, it is classified as even, and otherwise, it is classified as odd. The numbers are appended to the corresponding tuple.

### Calculating Squares of Numbers

```python
for num in favorite_number:
    sqr_info: tuple = (num, num ** 2)
    print(f"The Number {num} And It's square: {sqr_info}")
```

- This part calculates the square of each favorite number and prints it as a tuple in the form `(number, square)`.

### Summing the Numbers and Checking for Prime

```python
number_sum = sum(favorite_number)
print(f'Amazing! The sum of your favorite numbers is: {number_sum}')
```

- The sum of the favorite numbers is calculated and displayed.

```python
if number_sum > 1:
    for i in range(2, number_sum):
        if number_sum % i == 0:
            print(f"{number_sum} is not a prime number.")
            break
    else:
        print(f"Wow! {number_sum} is a prime number!")
else:
    print(f"{number_sum} is not a prime number.")
```

- The code checks whether the sum of the favorite numbers is a prime number. A number greater than 1 is prime if it is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself. If the sum is a prime number, it prints a message accordingly.

## Summary

- The code takes user input, classifies the numbers as even or odd, computes squares, sums the numbers, and checks whether the sum is a prime number.
